Hi there, my name is Nico. I am currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering senior with a focus on Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, and I expect to graduate with a B.S. in 2025.

During Summer 2023, I had the privilege of interning at Voaige where I worked on Geometric Computer Vision and Camera Calibration. At CMU, I have been a TA for 18-213 Introduction to Computer Systems in the Fall 2022 and Summer 2024 semesters.

My interests currently lie in Multimodal Machine Learning, Generative AI and Personalizable AI. Specifically, I believe that as our understanding and ability to deploy multimodal models improves, we should leverage these technologies to provide people better user experiences and more flexible options for AI choices.
Many useful AI systems are set up so people have to change their workflows to use them, as opposed to having them either integrated into their workflows or easier to use in existing environments. I aim to understand and develop frameworks that will give more power to users in deciding specific model or architecture choices in a larger system, and overall give more power to the user when using AI models.

In my free time, I go to the gym, listen to J-Pop, read Manga and play Single Player Games. My favorite artist is Zutomayo, my favorite Manga is Bluelock, and my favorite game series are Shin Megami Tensei and Pok√©mon. I enjoy travelling with either my friends or family whenever I can. My favorite places I've visited have been Japan and Spain!

I decided to start this website in June 2024 for the purpose of better organizing my ideas and projects as I learn more about Machine Learning and AI. I hope that my blog, paper reviews and projects can help popularize certain ideas in Multimodal ML, or help others understand different emerging technologies in the field. I also publish my blog posts and paper reviews to Medium. I also want to credit Fan Pu Zeng for his website, from which I drew inspiration from.
